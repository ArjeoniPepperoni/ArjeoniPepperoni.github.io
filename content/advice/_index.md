<h1 style="text-align: center;">Professional Advice</h1>

<div style="text-align: center;">

With three older sisters, right from the start,<br>
And four loving parents all playing a part.<br>
You grew up with guidance on every side,<br>
Advice flowing in like a rising tide.<br>
<br>
But this taught you a lesson, valuable and true,<br>
On how to give counsel, and ask for it too.<br>
You filtered the noise and you learned to be wise,<br>
Now you are the expert in everyone's eyes.<br>
<br>
Your family relies on their favourite Tech Wiz,<br>
To tell them exactly which button makes fizz.<br>
They build on your knowledge, you help them along,<br>
With advice on the hardware that never goes wrong.<br>
<br>
Yet Sint has a comment, a small critique,<br>
Call me old-fashioned, or maybe antique.<br>
But in my time, deep wisdom was shared with a cheer,<br>
And usually came with a glass of cold beer.<br>
<br>
And I mean the real stuff, with alcohol in it,<br>
Not zero-point-zero, not for a minute.<br>
So join with your family and partners beside,<br>
Let go of the brakes and enjoy the ride.<br>
<br>
Avoiding the booze might keep your health strong,<br>
But what good is life if it just feels too long?<br>
So grab a real pint, have a laugh and a shine,<br>
That is the advice from this Saint of thine.
