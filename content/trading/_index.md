<h1 style="text-align: center;">Procurement & Sales</h1>

<div style="text-align: center;">

"Procurement and Sales," a title so neat,<br>
Just fancy words for the trader off the street.<br>
It started in Minecraft, a long time ago,<br>
Where you hoarded the diamonds to make your wealth grow.<br>
<br>
Now packages arrive, at least three times a week,<br>
Or a Tweakers client, for the gadget they seek.<br>
How your neighbours endure it, I really don't know,<br>
With that constant stream of the logistic flow.<br>
<br>
This mindset is gold, I have to admit,<br>
In this capitalist world, it’s a perfect fit.<br>
As a Sales Engineer or a Buyer in-chief,<br>
You’ll make a career that is beyond belief.<br>
<br>
But here comes a warning, a note on the side,<br>
Think of the kids on that server where you traded with pride.<br>
The wealth that you gather, the profit you make,<br>
Must come from somewhere, from someone you take.<br>
<br>
I’m just an old man, dressed in socialist red,<br>
So keep this advice in the back of your head:<br>
Go shear the rich sheep, take the gold from their door,<br>
But share it back down with the humble and poor.

It was a true pleasure to rhyme for you, Thijs,<br>
With verses on hardware, and "liquid" advice.<br>
But please shut of your screen, the waiting is passed,<br>
Your "Tweakers" package is ready to open at last.<br>
<br>
