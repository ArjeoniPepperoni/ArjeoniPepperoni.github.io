<h1 style="text-align: center;">Custom Builds and a Custom Life</h1>

<div style="text-align: center;">

You build custom PCs with the perfect specs,<br>
Saving your friends from writing huge checks.<br>
From the fastest GPU to the quietest fan,<br>
You find the best parts, simply because you can.<br>
<br>
But Sint sees that "Custom" is more than a trade,<br>
It’s exactly how your own life choices are made.<br>
You don't pick a standard future off the shelf,<br>
You solder the connections to suit yourself.<br>
<br>
For love, you didn’t look in the local street,<br>
You found Orit, to make your system complete.<br>
Not a standard component found close at hand,<br>
But a unique treasure from a faraway land.<br>
<br>
For your best friend Alon, you cross the map,<br>
Bridging the distance and the digital gap.<br>
Heading to Israel, though times are intense,<br>
To be at his wedding makes perfect sense.<br>
<br>
And even your home base is a unique design,<br>
Living with Maartje, that big sister of thine.<br>
Everything customized, just like your gear,<br>
A lifestyle that suits you, year after year.
